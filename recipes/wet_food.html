    <h3><em>One of life's greatest pleasures (second only to humping my brother)!</em></h3>
    <p style="font-size: 16px"> </p>There's truly nothing better than the sound of a freshly opened can of wet food. It comes in different 
    <br>varieties such as pate, chunk, and gravy. Irritatingly, wet food is not served nearly as often as kibble.</p>
    <p>Making this dish takes 2-5 minutes depending on medication additions and the availability of a clean spoon.</p>

    <p><h4>Here's what you need:</h4></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Wet Food, 1 can</li>
        <li>Bowl, any size</li>
        <li>Medications (as needed)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Here's what you do:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>If applicable, wake up your human (see steps 1-5 of the <a href="../recipes/kibble.html">kibble</a> recipe for wake up instructions). </li>
        <li>Stand on the table and stare unblinkingly into your humans eyes.</li>
        <li>Meow at a volume that is at least twice your typical intensity so it is clear you are requesting wet food and not kibble.
            <br> 
            <em>If your human only provides kibble at this stage, continue staring and meowing until they realize their mistake.</em></li>
        <li>Once your human opens the can, increase meow intensity to maximum to provide affirmation that they have made the right choice.</li>
        <li>Your human may take the wet food into the kitchen to incorporate any necessary medications at this point. You will need to continue vocalizing 
            <br>throughout the incorporation process to ensure they do not forget to give you the food.</li>
        <li>Start eating as quickly as possible as soon as they begin to spoon out the food. DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THEY HAVE FULLY DISTRIBUTED THE FOOD! </li>
        <li>Assuming you followed step 6 closely, you should finish your wet food faster than your siblings and you can begin eating from their bowls.</li>
        <li>Once satiated, walk to another room to bathe yourself, but don't forget to return to the bowls in 5-10 minutes to finish off any residuals.</li>
        <li>When you are certain the bowls are clean, grab a couple bites of kibble regardless of whether or not you have any remaining stomach capacity. </li>
    </ol>
        <p><em> *Note* As there is no recognizable pattern for when humans will disperse wet food, you should follow these steps every time you find 
                <br>
                yourself in the kitchen at the same time as them (especially if you hear them open the utensil drawer).</em></p>
