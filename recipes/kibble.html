    <p style="font-size: 16px"> </p>Kibble is a palatable meal that is usually available 24/7. 
    It has been keeping me alive for a decade!</p>
    <p>Making this dish takes 1-30 minutes depending on the attentiveness of your human.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><h4>Here's what you need:</h4></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Kibble, 150g</li>
        <li>Bowl, any size</li>
        <li>Full bladder (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Here's what you do:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Check to see if your human is awake.</li>
        <li>If they are still sleeping, meow loudly in close proximity to their face.</li>
        <li>If they do not acknowledge you, walk on top of them (ideally on the head or stomach).</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 until they wake up.
            <br>
            <em>If you have come prepared with a full bladder, you may empty it on your human's pillow now to expedite this process.</em></li>
        <li>Lead them to the kitchen. You may need to stop, stare, and meow at them throughout this step as they are often easily distracted.</li>
        <li>Increase meow volume as you watch them scoop the kibble into your bowl.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!
            <br>
            <em>*Note* If you need a little extra entertainment, double your consumption speed. This will allow you to immediately purge the <br>
            undigested kibble which you can then watch your human clean up.</em>
        </li>
    </ol>
